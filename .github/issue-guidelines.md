1. **Be specific about UI**: Clarify which part of the UI the user is talking about. For example, many issues reference "the sidebar". If the user is talking about the output that the tool generates in the sidebar, suggest including mentions of the "Code Sidebar. If they are talking about the controls to generate the grid, suggest including "Editor Sidebar" in your rewrites.
3. **Be nice!**: Nobody likes being yelled at! Don't use all caps or a bunch of angry emojis. 
4. **Structure the issue**: Use the example below as a model of a clear, actionable bug report:

    ```
    ## Description

    <general descripion>

    ## Expected Behavior
