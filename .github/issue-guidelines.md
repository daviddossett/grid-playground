## General Guidelines
1. **List repro steps**: Use a easily-followed list of repro steps so we can quickly verify the issue.
2. **Include a screenshot**: This is a visual tool. Screenshots help us quickly understand what's gone wrong. 
3. **Be nice**: Nobody likes being yelled at! Don't use all caps or a bunch of angry emojis. It doesn't help.

## Description

When using grid-playground to generate a CSS grid, the "CSS" panel that shows the code output overflows off the edge of the screen.

## Expected Behavior

The CSS should wrap to fit within the constraints of the panel.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a new grid
2. Configure the grid to have 5+ rows and columns.
3. Observe that the `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns` values overflow of the right side of the panel.

Example code:
```
.grid-container { 
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 2fr 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 3fr;
  grid-column-gap: 23px;
  grid-row-gap: 32px;
  padding: 32px 48px; 
}
```
