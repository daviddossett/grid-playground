## General Guidelines
1. **Be specific when describing bugs**: Always include a general description of the issue, expected behavior, and repro steps. Tell users which parts of their issue are unclear based on the examples below.
2. **Include a screenshot if applicable**: This is a visual tool. Screenshots help us quickly understand what's gone wrong. 
3. **Don't use an inappropriate tone or language**: Be nice. Nobody likes being yelled at! Don't use all caps in the issue body.
